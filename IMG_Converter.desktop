#How to Create and Use a .desktop File
#
#1. Create the .desktop File
#   Open a terminal and type:
#
#   nano ~/.local/share/applications/MyApp.desktop
#
#   Replace "MyApp.desktop" with the desired name of your application.
#
#2. Add the Following Contents
#   Modify the paths accordingly:
#
#   [Desktop Entry]
#   Version=1.0
#   Name=My Application
#   Comment=Describe what your app does here.
#   Exec=python3 /path/to/your/script.py
#   Icon=/path/to/icon.png
#   Terminal=false
#   Type=Application
#   Categories=Utility;
#
#   Explanation:
#   - Name= → The display name of your application.
#   - Comment= → A short description of your application.
#   - Exec= → The command to execute your script.
#   - Icon= → The path to the icon image.
#   - Terminal=false → Set to "true" if the application runs in a terminal.
#   - Type=Application → Specifies that this is an application.
#   - Categories= → Defines the application category in the system menu.
#
#3. Save and Exit
#   - Press CTRL + X to exit.
#   - Press Y then Enter to save.
#
#4. Make the .desktop File Executable
#   Run the following command to make it executable:
#
#   chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/MyApp.desktop
#
#5. Update the Application Database
#   Run:
#
#   update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
#
#6. Launch the Application
#   - Search for the application in the system menu.
#   - Alternatively, run it manually using:
#
#     gtk-launch MyApp
#
#     (Replace "MyApp" with the actual name of your .desktop file.)
#
#7. Troubleshooting
#   - Check if the script runs manually:
#
#     python3 /path/to/your/script.py
#
#   - Validate the .desktop file:
#
#     desktop-file-validate ~/.local/share/applications/MyApp.desktop
#
#   - If necessary, find the absolute path of Python:
#
#     which python3
#
#     Then update the "Exec=" line with the absolute path:
#
#     Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
#
#Your application should now appear in the system menu and be launchable like any installed program.
